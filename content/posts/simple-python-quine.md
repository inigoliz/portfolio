## Self-replicating programs

Let's talk about self-replicating programs:

> A self-printing program - or *quine* - is a program that, when executed, prints it's own source code.

Why is this even relevant? Well, think about DNA, biological reproduction or even the [RepRap](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/RepRap) 3D printer movement.

There are many quines that you can see just with a quick Google. However, seeing them will give you no insight into self-replicating programs. Most are quite obfuscated and resemble esoteric code that appears to be the product of a convoluted form of prestidigitation. While they function, they often seem more like a way for the author to showcase their skills rather than a genuine exploration of the concept. 

In this post, I'll motivate and build **step-by-step** a simple Python quine.

Let's go.

## Spoiler alert: My Python quine

It's rather short:

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))' % (a, a))
```

This is what comes to the terminal when I run that code:

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))' % (a, a))
```

I can run it forever and it will always print itself, in an endless loop of execution.

## Exploiting the syntax

There are many techniques to build quines but here I'll use the following: exploiting a certain syntactic feature of a programming language.

In my case, the Python feature that I'll use is *string formatting*:

```python
a = 'hola'
print('%r' % a)
```

which prints:

```python
>> python quine.py
'hola'
```

The thing to note is that the printed result, `'hola'`, includes the quotes. That is the feature I'll exploit later. You'll soon see why this is important.

## Printing the print

Now that we have a way to print with quotes (`'_'`), we can start building the actual quine. The first thing that I did was to print the first line of the program using string formatting again:

```python
a = 'hola'
print('a = %r' % a)
```

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'hola'
```

That's progress.

Now, I'll try to also print the second line. If successfull, the quine is done.

First, I'll print the `print()`:

```python
a = 'hola'
print('a = %r\nprint()' % a)
```

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'hola'
print()
```

Last, I'll print the contents inside the `print()`. How? Easy: I can use `a` to hold the string inside the `print()`.

The following snippet is a bit *mind-bending*. But it's not too difficult to understand if you **stare at it** for a little while:

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r)' % (a, a))
```

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r)')
```

Ok, I made it quite far. But see the isue? The last part of the original program, `%Â (a,Â a)`, is still missing

How to achieve it?

## Breaking cycles

My first instinct to print the `%Â (a,Â a)` would be to just add it to the contents of `a`.

However, that doesn't work:

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r)' % (a, a))
```

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)')
#                                ^ misplaced quote
```

We're facing a common challenge when building quines: how do we print the quotes (`'`)?. If I was to include them in the `print()` statement, like `print("Â 'hola'Â ")`, then how would I print the `"` quotes now?

Building quines is all about breaking recursion cycles:

```
print('hola') -> print("print('hola')") -> print('''print("print('hola')")''') -> ?
```

After all, if a program were to print itself, it would mean -naively- that it should contain it's own source code *plus* the code that prints the source code. But then, it's source code should also contain the code to print itself. That's a recursion cycle and it's problematic. The goal is to break it somehow.

Some people address this challenge with a nifty trick: they print the quotes using their ASCII characters:

```python
print(chr(39) + chr(104) + chr(111) + chr(108) + chr(97) + chr(39))
```

```python
'hola'
```

That's, in theory, just exploiting yet another syntactic feature of the language. However, I don't like to depend on ASCII for my quine to work. It feels rather like a *dirty* trick.

Instead, I'll use a different technique. Actually, I've been using it since the beginning of this post: remember when I said I would use *string formatting* as my core *syntactic trick*? Well, this is why: it allows me to print quotes without having to write the quotes explicitly in the print.

How can we print the following *string*?

```python
print('hola')
```

I can use the following *source code*

```python
a = 'hola'
print('print(%r)' % (a))
```

```python
>> python quine.py
print('hola')
```

See where this is going? Using *string formatting* allows to print quotes *without* actually having to include the quotes *to be printed* in the print statement. That breaks the recursion cycle!

## Last details

Now, back to the quine. Before we had:

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r)' % (a, a))
```

Which printed, erroneously:

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r) % (a, a)')
#                                ^ misplaced quote
```

What if we include the `% (a, a)` in the `print()`? We must escape the `%` with `%%`:

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))' % (a, a))
```

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r)' % (a, a))
#                     ^ I must place %% (a, a) after here
```

Almost there. One last fix...

```python
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r) %% (a, a)'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))' % (a, a))
```

And there it is. The final **quine**:

```python
>> python quine.py
a = 'a = %r\nprint(%r %% (a, a))'
print('a = %r\nprint(%r) %% (a, a)' % (a, a))
```

## Quines and DNA

Let's consider DNA from an information processing perspective: DNA can be viewed as a program that, when executed, carries out specific actions and replicates itself. The mechanics of how a program achieves this are complex, and naively one might think that that capability might not even be feasible.

However, I hope that by this point in the blog post it feels somewhat possible that such a program might exist.

In fact, with a slight modification to the Python quine that I found before, I can enable the program to perform actions beyond mere self-replication. Just as DNA.

The following Python quine can be thought as a model of what DNA does:

```python
a = 'a = %r\ndo_other_stuff()\nprint(%r %% (a, a))'
do_other_stuff()
print('a = %r\ndo_other_stuff()\nprint(%r %% (a, a))' % (a, a))
```

Upon being run, the code executes `do_other_stuff()` which may have side-effects (e.g. create proteins), and finally it prints itself (or copies itself to a new cell).

(Sorry for my loose precision when writing about biology concepts ðŸ˜…)

## Wrapping up

I know, it takes a while to wrap one's head around the syntax acrobatics in quines.

One methapore I read somewhere which helped me build intuition around how quines work is the following:

> Imagine you're playin a game -one very boring game- called `SIMON REPEATS`. It's like *Simon says* but instead of saying, you repeat what you've been told. For example:
>
>```
>SIMON REPEATS HOLA   --execute-->   HOLA HOLA
>```
> It gets interesting if the *argument* is the same as the *instruction*.
>
>What happens if we pass `SIMON REPEATS` as an argument?
>
>```
>SIMON REPEATS SIMON REPEATS  --execute-->  SIMON REPEATS SIMON REPEATS  --execute-->  ...
>```
> You get the point: it goes on forever.

See? We have a loop. Or a cycle. Or a *fixed point* of the *instruction*.

In a way, quines are a fixed point of the underlying execution model (call it programming language or DNA operation): upon being executed, they produce a result that is ready to be executed again which, in turn, produces the same result.

Self-replicating stuff is great!
